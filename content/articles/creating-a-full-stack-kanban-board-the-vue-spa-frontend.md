This is part 1 of a 2 part series, you can find the second part on creating the Ruby on Rails backend here: [the Ruby on Rails API backend](/posts/creating-a-full-stack-kanban-board-the-ruby-on-rails-api-backend)

##### üí° Demo

The app we're creating is a full-stack kanban board where you can manage the cards with all CRUD (i.e. Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and the cards will automatically update in the database when moving it between different columns.¬†

You can find a demo of it here: [Demo Kanban Board](https://woetflow-demo-kanban-board.netlify.app/)

##### ‚öôÔ∏è Code

The example project's code can be found in these repositories on Github:

Vue frontend: https://github.com/WoetDev/woetflow-demo-kanban-board-vue¬†

Ruby on Rails backend: https://github.com/WoetDev/woetflow-demo-kanban-board-api

-------
<br>

## 1. Creating the Vue app
First thing we‚Äôll do is create our new Vue project. I used this blog post from BinarCode as an inspiration to build the board, but we‚Äôre gonna add a couple of important differences to more easily support the CRUD operations and the communication with the API. 

We‚Äôll be using the following third-party libraries to build the application:

* Quasar, for generating the project & use it for the UI components

* VueDraggable, for supporting the drag-and-drop functionality

* Axios, for making the API requests

* Vue-moment, for easy date formatting

### 1.1 Generating the Quasar project
Quasar is a frontend Vue component library built according to the material design specification. What‚Äôs great about Quasar is that it offers a great deal of functionality, styling & helpers out-of-the-box, but it‚Äôs still flexible enough to add additional customizations without needing to jump through hoops or straight-up run against a brick wall.

They also have their own CLI which offers a lot of benefits, but for now we‚Äôll only be using it to generate our project. 

If this is your first time using Quasar, you can install the CLI by running: ```yarn global add @quasar/cli```

Once installed, we can create the project with the command: ```quasar create woetflow-demo-kanban-board-vue```

Then, we‚Äôll get some questions for the configuration of our app which we‚Äôll answer with the following: 

```? Project name (internal usage for dev)``` (leave blank) 

```? Project product name (must start with letter if building mobile apps)``` KanbanBoard

```? Project description``` A full-stack kanban board

```? Author``` (leave blank)

```? Pick your favorite CSS preprocessor: (can be changed later)``` Sass with SCSS syntax

```? Pick a Quasar components & directives import strategy: (can be changed later)``` Auto-import in-use Quasar components & directives

```? Check the features needed for your project:```

ESLint (recommended), 

Vuex, 

Axios, 

IE11 support

```? Pick an ESLint preset:``` Prettier

```? Continue to install project dependencies after the project has been created? (recommended)``` Yes, use Yarn

* TIP: You can leave a space blank by pressing ‚ÄòEnter‚Äô

After answering everything, let the CLI do its thing and our project is created! 

As a last setup, we‚Äôll also add some npm scripts into our package.json so we can use yarn to start our development server and build for production.

```package.json:```

```json
"scripts": {
    "serve": "quasar dev",
    "build": "quasar build",
    "lint": "eslint --ext .js,.vue ./",
    "test": "echo \"No test specified\" && exit 0"
  },
```

To test if everything went good we can boot up our development server. 

Run: ```yarn serve```

Once compiled, the app should open automatically in a new tab and you should see the Quasar logo in the middle. 

### 1.2 Default code clean-up
Once you‚Äôve confirmed that it‚Äôs working, we‚Äôll clean up some of the default code so the following files will look like below.

```src/layouts/MainLayout.vue:```

```html
<template>
  <q-layout view="lHh Lpr lFf">
    <q-page-container>
      <router-view />
    </q-page-container>
  </q-layout>
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
export default {
  name: 'MainLayout'
}
</script>
```


```src/pages/Index.vue:```

```html
<template>
  <q-page class="flex flex-center">
  </q-page>
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
export default {
  name: 'PageIndex'
}
</script>
```

Also, delete the file ```src/components/EssentialLink.vue```

And now we‚Äôre set to start building the board. 

## 2. Creating the board and draggable cards

### 2.1 The Card component

The Card component doesn't contain any other components, so we‚Äôll start by creating this one.

```src/components/Card.vue:```

```html
<template>
    <q-card bordered class="cursor-move">
      <q-card-section>
        <div class="row items-center">
          <q-avatar>
            <img :src="card.user.value" :alt="card.title">
          </q-avatar>
          
          <span class="q-px-md col"><strong>{{ card.title }}</strong></span>
          <q-btn flat class="col-2">
            <q-icon name="create" size="sm" color="primary" class="action-button" />
          </q-btn>
        </div>

        <div class="row justify-center items-center">
          <span class="col text-italic q-pt-sm">
            {{ card.date }}
          </span>
          <q-chip v-if="card.tag" :color="`${chipColor}-1`" :class="`text-${chipColor}-9 text-weight-medium`" >
            {{ card.tag }}
          </q-chip>
        </div>
      </q-card-section>
    </q-card>
</template>
```
```javascript
<script>
export default {
  name: "Card",
  props: {
    card: {
      type: Object,
      required: true
    }
  },
  computed: {
    chipColor() {
      const mappings = {
        "Design": "purple",
        "Feature Request": "teal",
        "Backend": "blue",
        "QA": "green",
        'default': "teal"
      };
      return mappings[this.card.tag] || mappings.default;
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

So what‚Äôs going on in this component? 

* Everything that starts with ‚Äòq-‚Äô is a quasar component, and we‚Äôve added some properties and classes to each for styling & alignment. 

* The data that will be shown in this component, will be passed down as a prop from the parent component. So it won‚Äôt work for now since we haven‚Äôt built the parent component yet. 

* We‚Äôve also added the ```chipColor()``` computed property, each card can optionally have a tag. This computed property is used to determine which color this tag should be.

NOTE: if you‚Äôre using VS Code, Vetur might be giving the error ```‚ÄúProperty 'card' does not exist on type 'CombinedVueInstance<Vue, object, object, object, Record<never, any>>'."```

This is caused by a bug in Vetur, so for now we‚Äôll turn this off by setting ```vetur.experimental.templateInterpolationService``` to ```false```.

```settings.json:```

```json
{
  "vetur.validation.template": false,
  "vetur.format.enable": false,
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript", "javascriptreact", "typescript", "vue"],
  
  "vetur.experimental.templateInterpolationService": false
}
```

### 2.2 The Column component
Each card will be placed in a column, so now we‚Äôll create the parent Column component of the cards. 

First, we‚Äôll add the VueDraggable package to our app to support the drag-and-drop functionality.

Run: ```yarn add vuedraggable```

Each card will be placed in a column, so now we‚Äôll create the parent Column component of the cards. 

First, we‚Äôll add the VueDraggable package to our app to support the drag-and-drop functionality.

Run: ```yarn add vuedraggable```

This will give us access to a new draggable component to wrap around our cards. 

For now, we‚Äôll add a couple of cards as static data. But later on we‚Äôll replace this with cards from our Vuex store, which will contain the cards from our database.

```src/components/Column.vue:```

```html
<template>
  <div class="column q-py-md">
    <div class="c-bg-grey-1 q-pa-md q-mx-md rounded-borders text-blue-grey"><b>{{ column.label }}</b></div>

    <draggable 
      v-model="cards"
      :animation="200" 
      group="all-cards" 
      ghost-class="moving-card" 
      filter=".action-button" 
      class="q-pa-md q-mx-md q-gutter-md c-bg-grey-1 rounded-borders c-column"
    >
      <Card v-for="card in cards" :key="card.id" :card="card" />

    </draggable>
  </div>
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
import Draggable from 'vuedraggable'
import Card from '../components/Card.vue'

export default {
  name: "Column",
  props: {
    column: {
      type: Object,
      required: true
    },
    cards: {
      type: Array,
      required: true
    }
  },
  components: {
    Draggable,
    Card
  }
}
</script>
```

So what‚Äôs going on in this component? 

* Added a cards prop that we‚Äôll be receiving from the parent component so we can already test if our application is working as expected. Later on, we‚Äôll remove this prop and use the data from the Vuex store instead, since this will contain the data from our database.

* The column data that will be shown will be passed down as the column prop from the parent component. For now, it won‚Äôt work since we haven‚Äôt built the parent component yet. 

* We‚Äôve imported the Card component we created earlier. We‚Äôre using ```v-for="card in cards" :key="card.id" :card="card"``` to render a Card component for each card in the cards prop. We also pass down the information of the card in the current iteration as a prop to the child component. 

* We‚Äôve imported the Draggable component and wrapped this around our cards to enable the drag-and-drop functionality. We‚Äôve also added some options to this component to configure how the drag-and-drop will behave:

    * ```v-model="cards"``` will contain the list of cards in this column & track if the cards in the column are changing

    * ```:animation="200"``` will add an animation of 200ms when cards are being dragged in between columns or each other.

    * ```group="all-cards"``` says that all columns belong to the same group, so this will enable us to drag the cards between different columns

    * ```ghost-class="moving-card"```  will add the moving-card class to a card so we can customize the styling of a card while it‚Äôs being dragged. We‚Äôll be adding this styling in a bit. 

    * ```filter=".action-button"``` will prevent a card from being dragged when a user is clicking the ‚ÄòEdit‚Äô button in the Card component. 

We added some classes from Quasar for styling, but the classes ```c-bg-grey-1``` and ```c-column``` are custom ones that we‚Äôll be adding later on. 

### 2.3 The Index page
Now, it‚Äôs time to put both of these components together to create our Kanban Board page.

```src/pages/Index.vue:```

```html
<template>
  <q-page>
    <div class="flex justify-center">
      <div class="text-h4 text-primary q-py-md"><b>Kanban board</b></div>
    </div>

    <div class="flex justify-center">
      <Column v-for="column in columns" :key="column.id" :column="column"  />
    </div>    
    
  </q-page>
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
import Column from '../components/Column'

export default {
  name: 'PageIndex',
  data: () => ({
    columns: [
      {
          id: 1,
          label: "TO-DO",
          value: "to_do",
          created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.001Z",
          updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.001Z",
          cards: []
      },
      {
          id: 2,
          label: "IN PROGRESS",
          value: "in_progress",
          created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.020Z",
          updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.020Z",
          cards: [
              {
                  id: 38,
                  title: "Add steppers to order process",
                  date: "2021-02-24T00:00:00.000Z",
                  tag: "Backend",
                  created_at: "2021-01-28T22:38:09.601Z",
                  updated_at: "2021-01-29T10:05:56.538Z",
                  user: {
                      id: 4,
                      label: "Vincent Chase",
                      value: "https://pickaface.net/gallery/avatar/Opi51c74f6c56e40.png",
                      created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.067Z",
                      updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.067Z"
                  },
                  column: {
                      id: 2,
                      label: "IN PROGRESS",
                      value: "in_progress",
                      created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.020Z",
                      updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.020Z"
                  }
              }
          ]
      },
      {
          id: 3,
          label: "REVIEW",
          value: "review",
          created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.026Z",
          updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.026Z",
          cards: []
      },
      {
          id: 4,
          label: "DONE",
          value: "done",
          created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.031Z",
          updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.031Z",
          cards: [
              {
                  id: 21,
                  title: "Add paypal as a payment provider",
                  date: "2021-01-14T00:00:00.000Z",
                  tag: "Feature Request",
                  created_at: "2021-01-27T17:36:23.776Z",
                  updated_at: "2021-01-29T10:06:26.413Z",
                  user: {
                      id: 4,
                      label: "Vincent Chase",
                      value: "https://pickaface.net/gallery/avatar/Opi51c74f6c56e40.png",
                      created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.067Z",
                      updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.067Z"
                  },
                  column: {
                      id: 4,
                      label: "DONE",
                      value: "done",
                      created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.031Z",
                      updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.031Z"
                  }
              }
          ]
      }
    ]
  }),
  components: {
    Column
  }
}
</script>
```

So what‚Äôs going on in this page? 

* We imported the Column component to display each column and their cards on the page.

* We‚Äôve added the columns data property that contains all the information about the columns and its cards. We'll be replacing this static data property later on with the data from our Vuex store, which will hold the data from our database. 

### 2.4 Custom styling of the board and cards
To make everything look and feel better, we‚Äôll add a couple of custom styling rules. 

We‚Äôre gonna keep it light with the CSS and only add classes for styling our card when a user is dragging it, change the cursor when hovering over a card and give our columns a min-height and background so the cards are easier to drag between the columns. 

```src/css/app.scss:```

```scss
// Override defaults
body {
  background: white;
}

// Helpers
.cursor-move {
  cursor: move;
}

.c-bg-grey-1 {
  background: $blue-grey-1;
}

.c-column {
  min-height: 80vh;
  max-width: 95vw;
  width: 400px;
}

// Dynamic classes
.moving-card {
  opacity: 0.5;
  background: $blue-grey-1;
  border: 1px solid $blue-5;
}
```

### 2.5 Formatting the date
As a final step before we‚Äôll go and test the application we‚Äôve built so far, we‚Äôll format the date that appears on the card. Right now, the dates on the cards will appear in the ISO-8601 format (e.g. 2021-02-24T00:00:00.000Z) which computers love reading, humans however, not so much‚Ä¶ 

So we‚Äôll add the vue-moment package to our app which makes it very easy to change date formats if you provide it with an ISO-8601 string. 

Run: ```yarn add vue-moment```

In a Vue CLI app, you normally have the main.js file as the entry point of your app where you can add the dependencies of third-party libraries such as vue-moment. 

In a Quasar CLI app, you don‚Äôt have this file anymore and such third-party libraries must be added using boot files. Luckily, the level of simplicity is the same and it‚Äôs easier to keep an overview once you start adding more dependencies. 

Run: ```quasar new boot moment```

This command will create a new boot file called moment.js.

In this file we‚Äôll add our dependency code and after that we'll add it to the boot array. 

```src/boot/moment.js:```

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
Vue.use(require('vue-moment'));
quasar.conf.js:

‚Ä¶
   boot: [
      'axios',
      'moment'
    ],
...
```

Once we‚Äôve added the dependency all we still need to do is go back to our Card component and format the date. 

```src/components/Card.vue:```

```javascript
...
{{ card.date | moment("MMM D") }}
...
```

### 2.6 Testing our application
Now that we‚Äôve set up the columns and added some cards, let‚Äôs check out how our application is looking so far!

Run: ```yarn serve```

Once compiled, your app should have the following:

* Have 2 cards in the ‚Äòin progress‚Äô column and 1 in the ‚Äòdone‚Äô column

* Be able to drag these cards between each other and move them between columns. 

* Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre getting this error in the console: ```Avoid mutating a prop directly since the value will be overwritten whenever the parent component re-renders.```
We‚Äôll solve this by removing the cards prop and instead use the data in our Vuex store.

If something is not working as expected, you can find an overview of how the application code should look right now in [this commit](https://github.com/WoetDev/woetflow-demo-kanban-board-vue/tree/fa5458f9c7652b12b909b09aed8b1998dc596cd7)

## 3. Adding the CRUD operations and API requests
Now that you‚Äôve got a static working board, let‚Äôs make that complete by making it possible to manage all your cards & persist that information to the database through the Ruby on Rails API. Of course, we‚Äôll also need to make sure that everything behaves as expected without needing a single page refresh

Before you start this part of the Vue app, I‚Äôd recommend to hop over to the other part and setup the Ruby on Rails API first. Things we‚Äôll be doing in this part will make a lot more sense once you know what the API looks like and then you‚Äôll have a fully working board after this! 

But without further ado, let‚Äôs get started.

### 3.1 Adding the columns and cards from the database
To start adding our columns from data in our database, we‚Äôll first remove some of the code based on the static data we won‚Äôt be needing anymore. 

Remove the cards prop & the data properties section on the index page.

```src/pages/Index.vue:```

```javascript
...
<Column v-for="column in columns" :key="column.id" :column="column" :cards="column.cards"  />
 ...
 data: () => ({
    columns: [
      {
        id: 1,
        label: "TO-DO",
        value: "to_do",
        created_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.001Z",
        updated_at: "2021-01-26T22:39:27.001Z",
        cards: []
      },
    ...
    ]
  }),
...
```

Also remove this cards prop from the Column component. 

```src/components/Column.vue:```

```javascript
...
cards: {
  type: Array,
   required: true
}
...
```

So now that this code is removed, let‚Äôs re-add the columns from our database. 

To do that, we‚Äôll send an HTTP request to our API and keep track of the columns and their associated cards in the Vuex store. Using the Vuex store to keep track of the cards within the columns makes it a lot easier to keep this data in-sync across all the components. 

We‚Äôll start off by creating a new api.js file where we‚Äôll export the functions of our API requests and set the base settings for all requests. 

```src/api.js:```

```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

const API_URL = process.env.API_URL || "http://localhost:3000";

const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_URL,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
})

export default {
  getColumns() {
    return axiosInstance.get("/columns")
  },
  getUsers() {
    return axiosInstance.get("/users")
  },
  getCards() {
    return axiosInstance.get("/cards")
  },
  createCard(card) {
    return axiosInstance.post("/cards", card)
  },
  updateCard(card) {
    return axiosInstance.patch(`/cards/${card.id}`, card)
  },
  deleteCard(id) {
    return axiosInstance.delete(`/cards/${id}`)
  }
}
```

These are gonna be all the API requests we need to build and manage our board. 

We also added the base settings for our API requests; in development all requests will be to localhost:3000 and for production we can set the environment variable API_URL to whatever domain our API is hosted on for production. 

To learn more about environment variables in Vue, you can refer to the official documentation. However, since we're using Quasar environment variables are handled differently and they're added in the quasar.conf.js file instead of separate .env files.

Now let‚Äôs setup our Vuex store where we‚Äôll save the data from the reponses we receive from the API. 

```src/store/index.js:```

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'

Vue.use(Vuex)

export default function () {
  const Store = new Vuex.Store({
    state: {
      columns: []
    },
    getters: {},
    mutations: {
      setColumns(state, columns) {
        state.columns = columns
      },
      updateColumns(state, { column_id, cards }) {
        let column = state.columns.find(column => column.id === column_id)
        column.cards = cards
      }
    },
    actions: {},
    modules: {},

    // enable strict mode (adds overhead!)
    // for dev mode only
    strict: process.env.DEBUGGING
  })

  return Store
}
```

In the store, we added an empty columns array to the state. This will initially always be empty but we‚Äôll update the columns state with the setColumns mutation after we‚Äôve received the JSON response from our API. 

When a user is dragging cards between different columns, then we‚Äôll use the updateColumns mutation to update our columns state. 

With those things setup, let‚Äôs hop back to our Index page. 

On the Index page, we‚Äôll add a new computed property for the columns that will contain the current state of the columns in our Vuex store. 

```src/pages/Index.vue:```

```javascript
...
<script>
import api from '../api'
import Column from '../components/Column'

export default {
  name: 'PageIndex',
  components: {
    Column
  },
  computed: {
    columns: {
      get() {
        return this.$store.state.columns
      }
    }
  },
  created() {
    api.getColumns()
      .then(response => {
        this.$store.commit("setColumns", response.data)
      })
      .catch(error => console.log(error))
  }
}
</script>
```

We‚Äôre going to update the initial columns state in the ```created()``` method, this will get called as soon as the Index page is created for rendering. This uses the ```api.getColumns()``` function we created in api.js. Once we‚Äôve successfully received a JSON response from our API, we‚Äôll commit the setColumns mutation to update the columns state in our store. 

Finally, the only step we still need to do is to update our Column component to get the columns working correctly. 

```src/components/Column.vue:```

```javascript
...
<script>
import Draggable from 'vuedraggable'
import Card from '../components/Card.vue'

export default {
  name: "Column",
  props: {
    column: {
      type: Object,
      required: true
    }
  },
  components: {
    Draggable,
    Card
  },
  computed: {
    cards: {
      get() {
        return this.$store.state.columns.find(column => column.id === this.column.id).cards
      },
      set(cards) {
        let column_id = this.column.id
        this.$store.commit("updateColumns", { column_id, cards })
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

In the file we added a new computed setter for the cards. 

This is why it‚Äôs also important to extract the Column markup into a separate component. This enabled us to track the state of the cards for each individual column using v-model in the draggable component. This way we can use the computed setter to commit the mutation to update the columns state in the store once the user drags the card to a different position. 

### 3.2 Add a new card
To add a new card, we‚Äôll let the user manage the card information from a modal. We‚Äôll create the button to popup the modal and the modal itself in a new component. 

But first, let‚Äôs update our Vuex store to have the state properties and mutations we need to support creating a new card.

```src/store/index.js:```

```javascript
export default function () {
  const Store = new Vuex.Store({
    state: {
      columns: [],
      users: [],
      cardEditor: {},
      manageCardDialog: false
    },
    getters: {},
    mutations: {
      ...
      setUsers(state, users) {
        state.users = users
      },
      setManageCardDialog(state, manageCardDialog) {
        state.manageCardDialog = manageCardDialog
      },
      setCardEditor(state, card) {
        state.cardEditor = Object.assign({}, state.cardEditor, card);
        state.manageCardDialog = true
      },
      clearCardEditor(state) {
        state.cardEditor = {}
      }
    },
    ...
  })

  return Store
}
```

So what did we add to the store? 

* The users property will hold the list of all the users that can be associated with a card. We also added the setUsers mutation that will update the users state once we‚Äôve received this information from our API. 

* The cardEditor property will hold the information of the card that is currently shown in the editor. We also added two mutations to handle this information. 

* The setCardEditor mutation will create a new object by merging the properties of the current cardEditor state and overwrite any new card properties that we will pass in the parameters. It will then assign the cardEditor state to this newly created object. 

* The clearCardEditor mutation we‚Äôll use to ensure that the cardEditor object is blank. 

* The manageCardDialog property we‚Äôll use to more easily show or hide the modal across components. We added the setManageCardDialog mutation where we‚Äôll pass a boolean as a parameter to show or hide the modal. 

* The addCard mutation we‚Äôll use to update our store when the user has created a new card. This mutation will add the newly created card to the column.

Now that we‚Äôve updated our store, let‚Äôs go and create our new component.

```src/components/ManageCard.vue:```

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <q-btn label="New task" color="primary" icon="add" outline @click="onCreate" />

    <q-dialog
      v-model="manageCardDialog"
    >
      <q-card style="width: 700px; max-width: 80vw;" class="q-pa-lg">
        <q-card-section>

            <q-select outlined v-model="avatar" :options="users" label="User *" @filter="showUsers" lazy-rules

              <template v-slot:no-option>
                <q-item>

                  </q-item-section>
                </q-item>
              </template>
            </q-select>

            <q-select outlined v-model="status" :options="columns" label="Status *" lazy-rules
              :rules="[ val => val || 'Please select something']" />

            <q-input
              type="date"
              outlined

              label="Date *"
              lazy-rules
              :rules="[ val => val && val.length > 0 || 'Please choose a date']"
            />

            <q-select label="Tag" outlined v-model="tag" :options="tags"></q-select>

            <q-card-actions class="flex">
              <div class="col">
                <q-btn label="Submit" type="submit" color="primary"/>
                <q-btn label="Reset" type="reset" color="primary" class="q-ml-sm" flat />
                <q-btn label="Cancel" color="negative" flat v-close-popup="manageCardDialog" />
              </div>
            </q-card-actions>
          </q-form>
        </q-card-section>
      </q-card>
    </q-dialog>
  </div>
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
import { mapState } from "vuex"
import api from "../api"

export default {
  name: "ManageCard",
  data: () => ({
    tags: ["Design","Feature Request", "Backend", "QA"]
  }),
  computed: {
    columns() {
      return this.$store.state.columns
    },
    users: {
      set(users) {
        this.$store.commit("setUsers", users)
      },
      get() {
         return this.$store.state.users
      }
    },
    manageCardDialog: {
      set(manageCardDialog) {
        this.$store.commit("setManageCardDialog", manageCardDialog)
      },
      get() {
        return this.$store.state.manageCardDialog
      }
    },
    ...mapState(["cardEditor"]),
    id: {
      get() {
        return this.cardEditor.id
      }
    },
    title: {
      set(title) {
        this.$store.commit("setCardEditor", { title });
      },
      get() {
        return this.cardEditor.title
      }
    },
    avatar: {
      set(avatar) {
        this.$store.commit("setCardEditor", { avatar });
      },
      get() {
        return this.cardEditor.avatar
      }
    },
    status: {
      set(status) {
        this.$store.commit("setCardEditor", { status });
      },
      get() {
        return this.cardEditor.status
      }
    },
    date: {
      set(date) {
        this.$store.commit("setCardEditor", { date });
      },
      get() {
        return this.cardEditor.date
      }
    },
    tag: {
      set(tag) {
        this.$store.commit("setCardEditor", { tag });
      },
      get() {
        return this.cardEditor.tag
      }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    showUsers(val, update, abort) {
      if(this.users && this.users.length === 0) {
        api.getUsers()
          .then(response => {
            const users = response.data
            update(() => {
              this.users = users
            })
          })
          .catch(error => console.log(error))
      } 
      else {
        update()
        return
      }
    },
    onReset () {
      this.title = null
      this.avatar = null
      this.status = null
      this.date = null
      this.tag = null
    },
    onSubmit() {
      const card = {
        title: this.title,
        date: this.date,
        tag: this.tag,
        column_id: this.status.id,
        user_id: this.avatar.id
      }

      api.createCard(card)
        .then(response => {
          this.$store.commit("addCard", response.data);
          this.$store.commit("clearCardEditor")
        })
        .catch(error => console.log(error))
  
      this.$store.commit("setManageCardDialog", false)
    },
    onCreate() {
      this.$store.commit("clearCardEditor")
      this.$store.commit("setManageCardDialog", true)
    } 
  },
}
</script>
```

So what‚Äôs going on in this component?

* We‚Äôve added a button to create a ‚ÄòNew task‚Äô which will call the onCreate method. All the onCreate method does is make sure the cardEditor state is blank and show the modal. 

* We‚Äôve added inputs for the title, avatar (i.e. user), status (i.e. column), date and tag of the card. Each input also has validation if it‚Äôs required along with its computed setter so we can keep track of the input state in the store. We‚Äôre also lazy loading the list of users from our database once the user expands the avatar select input with the showUsers method.

* We‚Äôve added a reset button, this will call the onReset method which just makes everything in the editor blank again.

* We‚Äôve added the submit button, this will add the information from our inputs to a new object and persist this information to the database with an API request. Once we‚Äôve received a response that the card is successfully created, we‚Äôll update our columns state in the store with the newly created card, clear the cardEditor state and close the modal.

Now the last thing we need to do is import the ManageCard component into our Index page.

```src/pages/Index.vue:```

```html
<template>
  <q-page>
    <div class="flex justify-center">
      <div class="text-h4 text-primary q-py-md"><b>Kanban board</b></div>
    </div>

    <div class="flex justify-center">
      <ManageCard />
    </div>

    <div class="flex justify-center">
      <Column v-for="column in columns" :key="column.id" :column="column"  />
    </div>
  </q-page>
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
import api from '../api'
import Column from '../components/Column'
import ManageCard from '../components/ManageCard'

export default {
  name: 'PageIndex',
  components: {
    Column,
    ManageCard
  },
   ...
}
</script>
```

### 3.3 Update an existing card
To update existing cards, we‚Äôll also need to make a couple of adjustments to the store, Index page, Card and ManageCard components.

We‚Äôll start off with updating the Card component and adding a method to open the ManageCard modal and pre-fill all the inputs with the data from that card. 

```src/components/Card.vue:```

```html
<template>
...  
<span class="q-px-md col"><strong>{{ card.title }}</strong></span>
<q-btn flat class="col-2" @click="onEdit(card)">
  <q-icon name="create" size="sm" color="primary" class="action-button" />
</q-btn>
 ...
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
export default {
  name: "Card",
  ...
  methods: {
    onEdit(card) {
      const cardProperties = {
        avatar: { label: card.user.label, value: card.user.value },
        status: { label: card.column.label, value: card.column.value },
        date: this.$moment(card.date).format("YYYY-MM-DD"),
        user_id: card.user.id,
        column_id: card.column.id
      }

      const cardEditor = Object.assign({}, card, cardProperties)

      this.$store.commit("setCardEditor", cardEditor)
      this.$store.commit("setManageCardDialog", true)
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

So we added the new onEdit method, this will add the avatar and status properties to our card, because these are selects we need to give both the label and value to make this work correctly. We‚Äôre also adding the date in the format that the date input is expecting it. 

We assign the new properties to the new cardEditor variable and merge it with the already existing properties like the id. We then commit this new variable with the setCardEditor mutation to update the cardEditor state in the store. 

Then we‚Äôll go to our store and add a new mutation. 

```src/store/index.js:```

```javascript
export default function () {
  const Store = new Vuex.Store({
    ...
      updateCard(state, card) {
        state.columns.map(column => {
          let cards = column.cards
          let updatedCard = column.id === card.column.id ? card : null
          let cardIndex = cards.findIndex(i_card => i_card.id === card.id) > -1 ? cards.findIndex(i_card => i_card.id === card.id) : cards.length
          updatedCard ? cards.splice(cardIndex, 1, card) : cards.splice(cardIndex, 1)
        })        
      }
    ...
}
```

The updateCard mutation we‚Äôll commit to update the cards in the columns once we‚Äôve received a successful response from the API. 

Lastly, we‚Äôll update our ManageCard component to support this. 

```src/components/ManageCard.vue:```

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <q-btn label="New task" color="primary" icon="add" outline @click="onCreate" />

    <q-dialog
      v-model="manageCardDialog"
    >
      <q-card style="width: 700px; max-width: 80vw;" class="q-pa-lg">
        <q-card-section>
          <div class="text-h6 q-pb-md">
            <span v-if="cardEditor.id">UPDATE</span>
            <span v-else>CREATE</span>
            TASK
          </div>
          ...
        </q-card-section>
      </q-card>
    </q-dialog>
  </div>
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
import { mapState } from "vuex"
import api from "../api"

export default {
  ...
    onSubmit() {
      if(this.cardEditor.id == null) {
        const card = {
          title: this.title,
          date: this.date,
          tag: this.tag,
          column_id: this.status.id,
          user_id: this.avatar.id
        }

        api.createCard(card)
          .then(response => {
            this.$store.commit("addCard", response.data);
            this.$store.commit("clearCardEditor")
          })
          .catch(error => console.log(error))
      }
      
      else {
        const card = {
          id: this.id,
          title: this.title,
          date: this.date,
          tag: this.tag,
          column_id: this.status.id,
          user_id: this.avatar.id
        }

        api.updateCard(card)
          .then(response => {
            this.$store.commit("updateCard", response.data);
            this.$store.commit("clearCardEditor")
          })
          .catch(error => console.log(error))
      }
  
      this.$store.commit("setManageCardDialog", false)
    },
    ...
  },
}
</script>
```

So what did we add here?

* We‚Äôre checking the presence of an id to determine if the user is updating a card or creating a new one.

* Based on its presence, we change the title of the modal to display ‚ÄúCREATE TASK" or ‚ÄúUPDATE TASK".

* We also use this approach in the onSubmit method to determine if we should be sending a PATCH or POST request to our API and which mutations to commit.

### 3.4 Delete an existing card
With almost everything already setup, we just need a couple minor adjustments to support deleting cards. 

We‚Äôll again start by adding a new mutation to the store.

```src/store/index.js:```

```javascript
export default function () {
  const Store = new Vuex.Store({
    ...
      removeCard(state, card)  {
        let column = state.columns.find(column => column.id === card.column.id)
        let cards = column.cards
        cards.splice(cards.findIndex(i_card => i_card.id === card.id), 1)
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

This mutation will simply look up the card in the column and remove it. 

Now back to the ManageCard component to add the button and method to delete the card in our database with an API request and commit this mutation.

```src/components/ManageCard.vue:```

```html
<template>
    ...
    <q-card-actions class="flex">
      <div class="col">
        <q-btn label="Submit" type="submit" color="primary"/>
        <q-btn label="Reset" type="reset" color="primary" class="q-ml-sm" flat />
        <q-btn label="Cancel" color="negative" flat v-close-popup="manageCardDialog" />
      </div>
      <q-btn v-if="cardEditor.id" label="Delete" color="negative" @click="onDelete(cardEditor)" />
    </q-card-actions>
      ...
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
import { mapState } from "vuex"
import api from "../api"

export default {
  ...
    onDelete(card) {
      api.deleteCard(card.id)
        .then(
          this.$store.commit("setManageCardDialog", false),
          this.$store.commit("removeCard", card)
        )
        .catch(error => console.log(error))
    } 
  ...
}
</script>
```

So we check on the presence of an id again to determine if we should display the delete button. When clicked, the delete button will perform an API request to remove this card from the database. If we receive a successful response, then we‚Äôll also commit the mutation to remove this card from the column and close the modal. 

### 3.5 Update card positions
We‚Äôve finally arrived at the last thing we need to do to have our finished kanban board. 

A user can already update a card and change its column in the modal, but if a user changes a card‚Äôs column by dragging it to another one this won‚Äôt be persisted to the database yet. 

To make this possible, we‚Äôll need to track when the cards in a column change and persist this to our database accordingly. 

We already have the mutation updateColumns that updates the cards in the columns when dragging them, but we‚Äôll also need to add a new mutation that will update a card‚Äôs status input when dragged to another column.

```src/store/index.js:```

```javascript
export default function () {
  const Store = new Vuex.Store({
    ...
      updatePosition(state, updatedCard) {
        let updatedColumn = state.columns.find(i_column => i_column.id === updatedCard.column.id)
        let cardIndex = updatedColumn.cards.findIndex(i_card => i_card.id === updatedCard.id)
        updatedColumn.cards.splice(cardIndex, 1, updatedCard)
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

All we need to do now is track the change event in our Column component and make this trigger an event to update the database and commit this new mutation.

```src/components/Column.vue:```

```html
<template>
...

    <draggable 
      v-model="cards"
      :animation="200" 
      group="all-cards" 
      ghost-class="moving-card" 
      filter=".action-button" 
      class="q-pa-md q-mx-md q-gutter-md c-bg-grey-1 rounded-borders c-column"
      @change="changed($event, column)"
    >
      <Card v-for="card in cards" :key="card.id" :card="card" />

    </draggable>
...
</template>
```

```javascript
<script>
import api from '../api'
import Draggable from 'vuedraggable'
import Card from '../components/Card.vue'

export default {
 ...
  methods: {
    changed(e, column) {
      if(e && e.added) {
        const updatedCard = {
          id: e.added.element.id,
          column_id: column.id
        }
        api.updateCard(updatedCard)
          .then(response => {
            const card = response.data
            this.$store.commit("updatePosition", card)
          })
          .catch(error => console.log(error))
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

And that should be it! 

### 3.6 Testing our application
Awesome! You‚Äôve now built a full-stack kanban board. But before we start celebrating let‚Äôs test everything out to confirm if it‚Äôs working. 

So let‚Äôs boot up the application.

Run: ```yarn serve```

In your Ruby on Rails API root directory, run: ```rails s```

Once everything is running, you should see something similar to the following:

<article-image src="creating-a-full-stack-kanban-board-the-vue-spa-frontend/complete-kanban-board.jpg" alt="complete-kanban-board"></article-image>

* All columns are created and filled with cards from the database. 

* You can add new cards with the ‚ÄúNEW TASK" button

* You can also edit and delete cards when clicking the pen icon on the card.

* When dragging cards to different columns, they status of the card is correctly being updated when editing it. 

* With all these actions, you should see the HTTP requests being fired in the console and when you refresh the page, everything is still as you left it! 

If something is not working as expected, you can find an overview of how the application code should look right now in [this commit](https://github.com/WoetDev/woetflow-demo-kanban-board-vue/tree/5cbfbf42e4ec77463cd6b2fdbc9515b2e841302b).
